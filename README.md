# EmployeeTracker
This is a powerbi report made during my internship in a microsoft partner company where I was assigned the task to monitor the individual employees unavailability to office sync calls via whatsapp group
Data collection was done through office whatsapp group where the particular employee messaged on whatsapp [Will be late to sync call] then that employees records have been added in the excel sheet.
My attempt was to identify trends,patterns or insights from the data.
The project covered essential steps like:-
1)Data collection
2)Applying DAX functions as per need
3) Preparing Visuals
